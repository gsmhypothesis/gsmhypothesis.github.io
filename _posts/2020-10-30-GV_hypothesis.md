### The 2019 Pandemic - GSM Hypothesis

<p style="text-align: justify">As the human race battles for a crushing solution to end the SARS-Covid 2 Virus (or atleast mutate it for the greater good), the pandemic rages on. Infecting people across the Globe by defying medical theories, mathematical models, epidemiologists’ predictions and community medicine specialists’ hypothesis, the virus continues to prevent our lives from returning to the norm. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Hence the Virus Pandemic and its spread needs to be understood in the broader sense, viz.a.viz, its origin and its growth and spread.</p>

#### How did the virus come about?

<p style="text-align: justify">There has been much speculation that the Virus has had its origin at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China (Source for Virus origin in Wuhan – “Detection of Covid-19 in Children in Early January 2020 in Wuhan, China”). Other theories like the spread of this Virus from the nearby ‘Bat Hills’ of Wuhan and its proximity to Villages are not valid for the simple reason that ‘Bat Havens’ are found everywhere on the Globe. Additionally, there were no such trace of this Virus originating from the other such Bat ‘Hot Spots’. Hence the theory floated by the Chinese that the origin of this parasite is from the Animal Market of Wuhan and not Wuhan is likely untenable.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">:The changing genome sequence of this Virus indicates that the strong probability of Virus being man-made and hence contrived in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This is still strongly disputed in the scientific community, however. The factual pointers in this directions can be related to the eclipsing of the Virologist Dr.Shi by the Chinese Establishment. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The WIV lab, along with researchers in the U.S. and Switzerland, showed in 2015 the scary-good capability of bat coronaviruses to thrive in human cells. In that paper, which was published in 2015 in the journal Nature Medicine, they described how they had created a chimeric SARS-like virus out of the surface spike protein of a coronavirus found in horseshoe bats, called SHC014, and the backbone of a SARS virus that could be grown in mice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In 2018, after scientist diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Beijing visited the WIV, they were so concerned by the lack of safety and management at the lab that the diplomats sent two official warnings back to the U.S. (<a href="https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-wuhan-lab-complicated-origins.html">Source</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In this ghastly background of the enlarging and deepening tentacles of this pandemic, it is pertinent to mention the following speculative points : </p>

<ul>
  <l>The almost certain fact that the Virus originated from WIV indicates that Dr. Shi was very involved in the contrivation  of this particle. Dr.Shi is not available to us to reveal the exact intention and nature of this particle.</l>
  <l>There is every possibility that the creation of this Virus was part of a Biological Warfare program charted out by CPC/PLA with the intention of erasing a ‘target population’, when let loose. The ways and means of ‘letting loose’ a load of this Virus is debatable.</l>
  <l>The WIV would have also thought of a vaccine, for this virus, as the creator of this parasite.</l>
  <l>The WIV would have also thought of control measures of this Virus, in the event of an unlikely outbreak of this Virus, from its Lab.</l>
  
  
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">It is the fundamental job of the WHO to study the nature and origin of this so-called Virus and al suggest ways to the Global community of Humans and animals on the measures to counter it and its spread. In the absence of the WHO failing in its duties, the humans across the Globe are now facing this pandemic from the past six months, without a clue of an instant medicinal solution. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The genetic inquest on the kalash tribe- regarded as Alexander’s descendants all along,
has too negated the hazy Alexander descent hypothesis weaved around the Kalash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The strong common vestiges of ancient hindu/ancient vedic customs and practices
retained by the Kodavas and the Kalash, sharply indicate towards a probable original mix
and commonality of these two identical racial groups. The common tinge of retained
exclusive ancient hindu/ancient vedic practices bind the kodavas and Kalash into the
same group back though history. The striking cultural similarities between the Kodavas
and the Kalash gives rise to a strong hypothesis that these two racially identical and
unique ethnic groups are of the same parent stock and originated from the same racial
group.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The present physical distancing of the Kodavas and the Kalash may have its reason
somewhere deep down inside history pages. One strong possibility being that their
parent ethnic group may have been persecuted during the islamic invasion of the sub-
continent- forcing the group to split and migrate, one upwards into the mountain terrain
of Kybher, and the other down south into the safe mountain terrains of the western
ghats. Another possibility is the telescopic involvement of the Kodavas in tribal
migrations, along with other tribes, and branching out later, retaining their unique
identity.</p>
