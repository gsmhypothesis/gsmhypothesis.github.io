title: The Ancient Origins of the Kodavas: The Kodavas-Kalash Connection: GV Hypothesis
---


<p style="text-align: justify">The origins, history and ancestry of Kodavas- a mountain tribe in the present state of
Karnataka, South India, has been an intriguing puzzle, with various theories and
hypothesis floating.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There is a tribe called Kalash in the Chitral region of Kybher-pakhtunkhwa province of
Pakistan. They are from the dardic family of Indo-Aryans. The Kalash are considered to
be pakistan’s smallest ethno-religious groups practicing a religion classified as an ancient
form of Hinduism. They are considered unique among the people of Pakistan. The
related ethnic groups are Nuristanis and other Indo-Aryan peoples. The Kalash are
considered to be indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Chitral
valley from a location which was possibly further south, which the kalash call ‘Tsiyam’ in
their Folk songs. The languages spoken by these people are kalash, chitrali and urdu. The
Kalash are migrants or refugees, and they are also considered to be descendants of
Gandharis. The Kalash have maintained their own unique customs and traditions. The
culture and traditions of Kalash is stunningly unique, in comparison with the
contemporary Islamic traditions and practices surrounding them in the chitral valley. The
kalash have aggressively preserved these traditions. They are polytheists and nature
plays a highly significant and spiritual role in their daily lives. The kalash tribals offer
sacrifices and hold festivals to thank nature for the abundant resources of the three
valleys (Kalasha Desh). The Kalasha mythology and folklore though have been compared
to ancient Greece, has been found closer to Hindu traditions of the Indian sub-continent.
The Kalash are basically mountain people, celebrating three main festivals- one in may
(chilam joshi), another in autumn (Uchau), and another (caumus) in mid-winter. The
most important Kalash festival is the Chowmos ( caumus), which is celebrated during
December (chaturmasya), which marks the end of the year’s field work and harvest. The
main Chowmus ritual takes place at a Tok tree, which is denoted as Indra’s place-
‘Indrunkot’ or ‘Indreyin’. Horses, goats, cows and sheep were sacrificed. The traditional
Kalash religious practices is considered to display traits of myths, ritual, society which
echoes many aspects of Rig-vedic religion, including pre-vedic practices and beliefs,
regarded as a form of ancient Hinduism. Mahandeo is a deity to whom the Kalash pray
to (Mahadev, as is known in another parts of the Indian sub-continent). The creator
deity Imra (Yama Rajan) is called Dezau (Dezaw) whose name is derived from Indo-
European dheigh. Dezauhe is also referred to by the Pashto term Khodai. Tsyam is
considered as the mythological homeland of the Kalash. Crows represent the ancestors,
and the Kalash feed them by their left hand, as in Vedic practice. The dead are buried
above ground in ornamented wooden coffins. The Kalashi traditional music includes
flute-like instruments (high-pitch), singing, poetry, clapping, and also the rhythmic
playing of drums- Wac ( a small hourglass drum) and Dau ( a large drum played with the
smaller drum Wac).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Genetic Origins of the Kalash : West Eurasian origins have been genetically detected in a
study on the kalash. The Kalash are also detected to have distinct aboriginal links with
only minor contributions from outside people. Another study showed them to be
clustered with central/ south Asian populations. Interestingly, another study found no
evidence of their descent from soldiers of Alexander. A further study revealed the Kalash
are part of the South Asian genetic continuum with no Macedonian ethnic admixture
albeit shifted towards the Iranian people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Historically, the Kalash are stated to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their
ancestors migrating to Afghanistan from a distant place in South Asia, which the kalash
call ‘Tsiyam’ in their folk songs and epics. Kalashi traditions record severe persecution
and massacres in the hands of Rais dynasty’s Shah Nader Rais between 1720 to 1747,
after which the Kalash had to flee the Chitral valley, and those who remained still
practising their faith had to pay tribute in kind or with Corvee labour.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Kodavas are an exclusive ethnic mountain people, practising an exclusive form of
religion and traditions which can be strongly linked to a kind of ancient Hinduist practice.
Among the various theories floating about the history and racial origins of the Kodavas,
the theory of descent from Alexander’s battalion is so far the strongest.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Religious, cultural practices and traditions of the Kodavas: The Kodavas are a hunting,
mountain seeking martial race with nomadic antecedents. The Kodava traditional music
includes drums, trumphets, pipes, singing, poetry and clapping. Their tradition also
includes folk-lores, folk-dances and folk-songs. From earliest days, the kodavas are
known to worship Nature and Ancestors. Historically, the Kodavas are worshippers of
Sun. Apparently this trait of worshipping Sun and nature has been handed over since
ancient days. Their worshipping place ‘Kaimada’ which is linked to ceremonial rituals in
honour of ancestors, the positioning of the ‘Kaimada’ within the sight of the Sun and
Moon, displays ancient vedic tinge . The ‘Kaimada’ and the ‘Ain Mane’ were built facing
the east, towards the rising Sun. The erection of a bamboo pole- ‘Kodimara’ in front of
the ‘Kaimada’ was meant to indicate the nature of the occasion. Their worshipping the
river Kaveri as their Goddess, with special prayers offered on ‘Kaveri Sankramana’ day in
clearly indicates Aryan origins, in concept. While facing the rising sun in the morning, in
salutation, an auspicious rite is enacted involving rice and milk. The Kodavas offer fowls
to the Spirit ‘Kuliya’ inside the forests through ‘Devara kaadu- an act of appeasing the
nature through the ancestors. The propitiation of ancestors once a year through
‘Kaarana Bharani’. The ‘Nellakki Bolucha’ meaning the lighting of the ceremonial oil
lamp- both in the morning and evening is an age-old practice of ancestor worship. The
Kodavas observe three most important festivals- Kailpodh or Kailmuhurtha (September),
Kaveri Sankramana (October) and Puthri or Huthri (November-December). The kailpodh
is a festival indicating the end of ploughing and transplanting sessions of the paddy crop.
The Huthri festival heralds the ripening of the paddy crop. The utterance “Poly Poly
Deva” during this festival is considered as deeply ancient in origins.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Theory of Kodavas’ descent from Alexander’s battalion negated : For a racial ethnic
group to separate itself from a war battalion and migrate out compactly as a
reproducing group, the descent from Alexander’s battalion theory is highly flawed. A
detached group from a multi-racial battalion to later re-evolve itself as a compact ethnic
group displaying ancient hinduist practices becomes a remote possibility. Such ethnised
group should have identical ethnic elements with familial similarity to survive and
flourish as a uniform and identical intra-ethnic group. In the absence of identifying the
methodology of absorption of the strong ethnic and cultural identity as exhibited by the
Kodavas, the ‘Alexander Battalion’ theory fails. Empirically, the possibility of evolvement
of an ethnic group from a battalion consisting of mixed-race soldiers grouping together
as a clan, and stretching backwards and imbibing ancient form of vedic practices and
unique cultural symptoms defies the concept of group survival. A grown-up
heterogeneous group of soldiers, with their kin, cannot all of a sudden imbibe alien preancient practices. Only an exclusive pre-existing ethnic group can absorb and practise
stiff ancient version of Hinduist/vedic ideals, passing it down the generations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The genetic inquest on the kalash tribe- regarded as Alexander’s descendants all along,
has too negated the hazy Alexander descent hypothesis weaved around the Kalash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The strong common vestiges of ancient hindu/ancient vedic customs and practices
retained by the Kodavas and the Kalash, sharply indicate towards a probable original mix
and commonality of these two identical racial groups. The common tinge of retained
exclusive ancient hindu/ancient vedic practices bind the kodavas and Kalash into the
same group back though history. The striking cultural similarities between the Kodavas
and the Kalash gives rise to a strong hypothesis that these two racially identical and
unique ethnic groups are of the same parent stock and originated from the same racial
group.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The present physical distancing of the Kodavas and the Kalash may have its reason
somewhere deep down inside history pages. One strong possibility being that their
parent ethnic group may have been persecuted during the islamic invasion of the sub-
continent- forcing the group to split and migrate, one upwards into the mountain terrain
of Kybher, and the other down south into the safe mountain terrains of the western
ghats. Another possibility is the telescopic involvement of the Kodavas in tribal
migrations, along with other tribes, and branching out later, retaining their unique
identity.</p>
